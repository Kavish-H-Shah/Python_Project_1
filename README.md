# Movies Correlation
## The project aims to explore the relationships between different movie attributes that impact the success of it.

#### Description:
This project is a Python script that analyzes and visualizes movie data using the Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries. It reads a dataset from a CSV file, performs data cleaning and manipulation, calculates correlations between different variables, and generates visualizations to explore the relationships between budget, gross revenue, and other movie attributes. There are 7669 movies in the dataset 

#### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- pandas
- seaborn
- numpy
- matplotlib

#### Aim
The script generates visualizations that help explore the relationships between different movie attributes. The scatter plot visualizes the correlation between budget and gross revenue, while the heatmap provides a comprehensive view of the correlations between multiple variables.
